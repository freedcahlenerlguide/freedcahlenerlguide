A payday loan is a type of emergency loan that gets its name from its repayment structure. Generally speaking, you’ll get the money up front and write the lender a postdated check. On your next payday, you’ll make a ‘balloon payment’ – the entire principal plus fees – or the lender will deposit the check and the money will come out of your account.

While payday loans are an easy way to access fast cash, they are also costly. In fact, most come with triple-digit interest rates that can sometimes exceed the 500-percent mark. This, combined with their short repayment period, is what makes these loans so risky.
