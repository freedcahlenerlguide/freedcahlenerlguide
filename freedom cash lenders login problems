Most payday lenders give borrowers approximately two weeks to pay the loan back. Unfortunately, the likelihood of repaying the entire balance by the due date is low, which means you’ll default on the agreement or incur an additional finance charge to roll the balance over.
Steep fees

The fees and interest rates on payday loans are sky-high. Plus, you’ll be hit with even more fees if you don’t repay a payday loan by the time you get your next check. Going this route can get you caught up in a vicious spending-and-borrowing cycle.
Potential credit damage

If you reach the maximum number of rollovers and still can’t repay the loan, your credit health could be at risk. The payday lender could report the delinquent balance to the three credit reporting agencies or sell your account to a collection agency. Either way, your credit score will likely drop by several points due to the negative repayment history. Not only that, but, depending on how many days you’re delinquent, you could also face legal action, further stretching your financial situation.
